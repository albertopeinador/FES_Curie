$\LARGE{\text{Main Programme}}$

Most of the project is writen in the one Jupyter Notebook, should be decently easy to follow despite minimal comments.

$\LARGE{\text{Module}}$

For this we built a porpouse-made module for uncertanty propagation. Not much thought went into it. Very basic and probably just bad, but it gets the job done.

$\LARGE{\text{Other}}$

The rest of the files are either the data (in .csv, .numbers or .xlsx) of the output files from the Notebook.
